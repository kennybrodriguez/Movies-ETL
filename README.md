# Movies-ETL
This project focused on extracting, transforming, and loading data from disparate sources using Python. This project took movie data that was in 2 csv's and a json file and first loaded the data in. Then used functions to clean the data and also merge the data to build a DataFrame that joined all 3 data sources. Lastly, the files were uploaded to a SQL server to complete the ETL process.
